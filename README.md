# SEAT HEATING SYSTEM

This project is a seat heating system in a car. When a passenger has occupied a seat and the heater is turned ON, the LED glows. Temperature can be adjusted by turning the knob. The project is implemented using ATMEGA-328 Microcontroller. The temperature can be checked in the serial monitor.
